"""pygraphblas is a python package that exposes [The GraphBLAS
API](http://graphblas.org) to the [Python](https://python.org)
programming language.  It uses the
[CFFI](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library to wrap the low
level GraphBLAS API from
[SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/GraphBLAS.html). The
`pygraphblas` module provides high level types like
`pygraphblas.Matrix` and `pygraphblas.Vector` that make working with
the GraphBLAS in Python extremely simple and easy.

See the [Github README](https://github.com/Graphegon/pygraphblas) for
details on how to install pygraphblas. 

The core idea of the GraphBLAS is the mathematical duality between a
graph and a `pygraphblas.Matrix`.  There are a few ways to contstruct
matricies, but a simple approach is to provide three lists of data,
the first are are lists of the row and column positions that define
the begining and end of a graph edge, and the third list is the weight
for that edge:

>>> import pygraphblas as gb
>>> I = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6]
>>> J = [1, 3, 4, 6, 5, 0, 2, 5, 2, 2, 3, 4]
>>> V = [True] * len(I)
>>> M = gb.Matrix.from_lists(I, J, V)
>>> print(M)
      0  1  2  3  4  5  6
  0|     t     t         |  0
  1|              t     t|  1
  2|                 t   |  2
  3|  t     t            |  3
  4|                 t   |  4
  5|        t            |  5
  6|        t  t  t      |  6
      0  1  2  3  4  5  6

>>> g = gb.gviz.draw_graph(M, show_weight=False, 
...     filename='/docs/imgs/Matrix_from_lists2')

>>> g = gb.gviz.draw_matrix(M, scale=40, 
...     filename='/docs/imgs/Matrix_from_lists_matrix')

GraphBLAS is a sparse [Linear
Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra) API optimized
for processing graphs encoded as sparse matrices and vectors.  In
addition to common real/integer `pygraphblas.Matrix` algebra
operations, GraphBLAS supports over a thousand different
[Semiring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiring) algebra operations,
that can be used as basic building blocks to implement a wide variety
of graph algorithms. See
[Applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiring#Applications)
from Wikipedia for some specific examples.

The core operation of Linear Algebra is [Matrix
Multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication).
In this GraphBLAS duality, this is an operation along the edges of a
graph from nodes to their adjacenct neighbors, taking one step in a
[Breadth First
Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) across the
graph:

>>> v = gb.Vector.from_lists([0], [True], M.nrows)
>>> y = v @ M
>>> g = gb.gviz.draw_matrix_op(v, '@', M, y, scale=40, labels=True, 
... column=False, filename='/docs/imgs/bfs_step')

pygraphblas leverages the expertise in the field of sparse matrix
programming by [The GraphBLAS Forum](http://graphblas.org) and uses
the
[SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/GraphBLAS.html)
API implementation. SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS is brought to us by the work
of [Dr. Tim Davis](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/welcome.html),
professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at
Texas A&M University.  [News and
information](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/news.html) can provide
you with a lot more background information.
