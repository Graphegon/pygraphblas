"""
pygraphblas is a python extension that bridges [The GraphBLAS
API](http://graphblas.org) with the [Python](https://python.org)
programming language.  It uses the
[CFFI](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library to wrap the low
level GraphBLAS API and provides high level Matrix and Vector Python
types that make GraphBLAS simple and easy.

![Adjacency Matrix](../AdjacencyMatrix.png)

GraphBLAS is a sparse linear algebra API optimized for processing
graphs encoded as sparse matrices and vectors.  In addition to common
real/integer matrix algebra operations, GraphBLAS supports over a
thousand different [Semiring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiring)
algebra operations, that can be used as basic building blocks to
implement a wide variety of graph algorithms. See
[Applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiring#Applications)
from Wikipedia for some specific examples.

pygraphblas leverages the expertise in the field of sparse matrix
programming by [The GraphBLAS Forum](http://graphblas.org) and uses
the
[SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/GraphBLAS.html)
API implementation. SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS is brought to us by the work
of [Dr. Tim Davis](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/welcome.html),
professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at
Texas A&M University.  [News and
information](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/news.html) can provide
you with a lot more background information.
