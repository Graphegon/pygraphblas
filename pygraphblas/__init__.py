"""pygraphblas is a python extension that bridges [The GraphBLAS
API](http://graphblas.org) with the [Python](https://python.org)
programming language.  It uses the
[CFFI](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library to wrap the low
level GraphBLAS API and provides high level Matrix and Vector Python
types that make GraphBLAS simple and easy.

The core idea of the GraphBLAS is the mathematical duality between a
graph and a matrix.  As illustrated here, a graph can be expressed as
a matrix and vice versa.

GraphBLAS is a sparse [Linear
Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra) API optimized
for processing graphs encoded as sparse matrices and vectors.  In
addition to common real/integer matrix algebra operations, GraphBLAS
supports over a thousand different
[Semiring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiring) algebra operations,
that can be used as basic building blocks to implement a wide variety
of graph algorithms. See
[Applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiring#Applications)
from Wikipedia for some specific examples.

The core operation of Linear Algebra is [Matrix
Multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication).
In this GraphBLAS duality, this is an operation along the edges of a
graph from nodes to their adjacenct neighbors, taking one step in a
[Breadth First
Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) across the
graph:

pygraphblas leverages the expertise in the field of sparse matrix
programming by [The GraphBLAS Forum](http://graphblas.org) and uses
the
[SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/GraphBLAS.html)
API implementation. SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS is brought to us by the work
of [Dr. Tim Davis](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/welcome.html),
professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at
Texas A&M University.  [News and
information](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/news.html) can provide
you with a lot more background information.
